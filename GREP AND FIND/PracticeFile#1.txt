Begin practice of file processing with python:

This will be multiple lines of text to text reading and printing the text as lines of text using a for loop to do it.  The simple code for this process will be:

xfine = open(‚Äúmbox.txt‚Äù)
for line in xfile :
	print(line)

I will repeat this over and over to make a long list of lines for processing with the for statement and other commands to begin to understanding how to use python to process files..

From here I will repeat over and over.
